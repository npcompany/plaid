# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- (storage/writer) add optional `sample_callback` to `save_to_disk`, invoked once per sample right after it is written to disk as `sample_callback(split_name, index, sample_path)`. This lets callers process samples one by one once written instead of waiting for the whole dataset. Currently supported for the `cgns` backend, including parallel writing (`num_proc > 1`), where the callback runs inside the worker processes and must be picklable and process-safe.

### Fixed

- (storage/reader) Fix HF backend split download not respecting `~` character on Linux.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-07

- This version introduces major modifications of the library.

### Added

- (utils/cgns_helper) add `get_element_names` utility to extract element names from a CGNS tree.
- (docs) add an upgrade guide describing breaking changes when migrating from the `0.1.x` series to `v1.0.0`.
- Add files to support mybinder.org
- (plaid-check) add a simple app to check the integrity of a plaid database
- (dataset-viewer) add a trame app for dataset visual exploration.
- (sample/features) add_field: check field size consistency with geometrical support.
- (sample) add `set_trees` to `Sample` delegated methods: `sample.set_trees(...)` now works as a direct proxy to `SampleFeatures.set_trees`, consistent with other delegated tree methods.

### Changed

- (sample) **Breaking**: remove the `path` constructor argument from `Sample`; use `Sample.load_from_dir(path)` or `sample.load(path)` for explicit disk loading.
- (infos) add an infos.py file with a pydantic Info class at the same level as ProblemDefinition.
- (cgns_backend) remove constant/variable mechanism in reading and writing paths for the cgns_backend.
- (docs) update logos and migrate to Zensical.
- (problem_definition) rename add_(in/out)_features_identifiers to add_(in/out)put_features. Impose order in yaml keys.

### Fixes

- (constants) fix memmaps types correctly, by inferring from constant_schema.

### Removed

- (examples) remove downloadable_example from run_examples scripts to prevent crash when huggingface services are not fully operational.

## [0.1.15] - 2026-03-25

### Changed

- (storage/writer) **Breaking**: simplify `save_to_disk` API — replace `generators` (dict of `functools.partial`) with two explicit parameters: `sample_constructor` (a callable taking a single identifier and returning a `Sample`) and `ids` (a dict mapping split names to sliceable sequences of identifiers of any type). PLAID now handles iteration, generator creation, and parallel sharding internally.

### Fixes

- (storage/writer) generate_datasetdict_to_disk: free DatasetDict memory after saving to disk to release for tempfile

## [0.1.14] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- (env) add uv-compatible environment management for Linux

### Changed

- (storage/writer) simplify parallel dataset generation API: `save_to_disk` now exposes `split_n_samples` as the high-level sharding entrypoint while keeping `gen_kwargs` for backward compatibility.
- (storage/docs) clarify generator contract for storage writing: generators must accept `ids`; with `split_n_samples`, these are local split indices (`0..n-1`) and are internally sharded by PLAID when `num_proc > 1`.
- (tutorials/storage) update parallel and sequential examples to consistently handle local-vs-global indexing when using curated split subsets.
- (containers/features) `add_field` now warns and auto-converts `np.int32`/`np.int64` fields to `np.float64` for CGNS compatibility.
- (sample) add_tree: add in_place arg to decide whether the added tree should be kept unchanged (with in_place=False).
- (docs/actions) better explain which package and dev env for which OS, and repair readthedocs generation.
- (containers/managers) return a warning when an automatically resolved time stamp is different from 0.0.
- (storage/writer) add validate_required_infos before creating and pushing heavy data to prevent later error
- (storage) add splits args to init_from_disk, add train_test_split for all backends.
- (utils/cgns_helper) add update_features_for_CGNS_compatibility which enable filtering features in conv.to_plaid while maintaining a correct CGNS tree (geometrical support is kept when only a field is requested, for instance).
- (containers/utils) strengthen `_check_names` to support `None` values and enforce CGNS node name length constraints (<=32 characters).
- (containers/features) validate all names in input trees in `SampleFeatures.add_tree` before insertion.

### Fixes

- (storage/writer) save_to_disk: dataset write has been moved after metadata writes, for errors concerning meta data to be raised instantly (without waiting for all the heavy data to be written)
- (storage/common/reader) clarify constants loading policy: local disk keeps numeric constants as `np.memmap` for efficiency, while Hub metadata loading materializes them to in-memory arrays to avoid temporary-directory lifetime issues.
- (sample) get_global in the scalar case now returns the scalar with the original type.
- (datasets) fix missing location use in get_field_names, and improve corresponding tests.
- (cgns_helpers) update_features_for_CGNS_compatibility: fix behavior where input variable was modified by the function.
- (storage/common/preprocessor) make constant_features split-dependant.
- (storage/zarr/bridge) remove missing keys check: required for zarr backend for which written features cannot be `None`.
- (storage/common/bridge) complete missing keys with `None` in bridges: required for reading zarr backend for which written features cannot be `None`.
- (storage) fix cgns and zarr parallel writers (spawn as many processes as num_proc instead of num_shards)
- (sample) fix fields summarize in `__str__`
- (tests/containers) update sample field-name fixtures and add dedicated coverage for invalid CGNS name lengths.

### Removed

- (storage) remove train_test_split - this lead to unwanted behaviors with the `hf_datasets` backend.
- (storage) remove `extra_fields` and useless `__setattr__`/`__getattr__` mechanisms.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-01-22

### Added

- (storage/reader) Converter class: to_dict now takes features argument to prevent reading complete samples.
- (containers/utils) add get_feature_details_from_path.
- (problem_definition) add set_[out/in]_features_identifiers.
- (containers/managers/default_manager) A new DefaultManager class to handle default CGNS context values (base, zone, time).

### Changed

- (sample/features) rename get_mesh to get_tree to homogeneize syntax, and add `only_mesh` option.
- (utils) move storage/common/tree_hjandling methods to utils/cgns_helpers to prevent circular imports.
- (storage) minor refactoring, simplify configure_dataset_card for all backends, problem_definitions handles as a dict instead of a list, change pickle support to numpy.memmap + json for constant parts of the CGNS trees, add `path` param to dataset when read from disk.
- (SampleFeatures) renamed `get_$_assigment` to `resolve_$`. For instance: `get_time_assginment` -> `resolve_time`.
- (storage) Refactor storage backends to use a common interface.

## [0.1.12] - 2025-12-20

### Changed

- (tests) improve temp folder handling.

### Fixes

- (storage/hf_datasets/reader) correct folder existence check in download_datasetdict_from_hub.

## [0.1.11] - 2025-12-19

### Added

- (storage) refactore the bridge to rely on a generic storage mechanism, with 3 backends developped: cgns, hf_datasets and zarr.
- (docs) improve contribution guidelines.

### Changed

- (storage) hf_datasets backend: modify `init_datasetdict_from_disk` implementation for very minimal cache usage.
- (storage) `generator_to_datasetdict` add cache_dir argument and set hf_dataset backend's `generate_datasetdict_to_disk` to use a temporary directory and cache_dir.
- (huggingface bridge) full parallel support in `from_generator`, with optimization of constant leaf detection (no large data communicated between processes).
- (samples/features) add string support to globals.
- (huggingface bridge) correct split_constant tree derivation, add heuristic for number of shards usage in push_to_dict, robustify infer_hf_features_from_value with respect to numpy arrays of strings, modernize update_dataset_card.
- (dependencies) migrate to muscat=2.5.1.
- (types/containers) move `FeatureIdentifier` class from `plaid.types` to `plaid.containers`.
- (features) rename `get_all_mesh_times()` to `get_all_time_values()`.

### Fixes

- (dataset/huggingface_bridge) add optional `warn` parameter to `Dataset.set_infos()` to allow silent replacement of infos; `huggingface_dataset_to_plaid` now uses `warn=False` to prevent unnecessary warnings.
- (types/containers) move `FeatureIdentifier` class from `plaid.types` to `plaid.containers`.
- (features) rename `get_all_mesh_times()` to `get_all_time_values()`.

### Removed

## [0.1.10] - 2025-10-29

### Added

- (problem_definition) add train_ and test_split mechanisms and constant_feature support.
- (dataset/problem_definition) add plaid version to infos.
- (sample) add `memory_safe` to save to run pyCGNS save in a subprocess and prevent memory leaks.
- (sample) add `del_feature` method and rename `_add_feature` without leading underscore.
- (docs) explain release process in Contributing page.

### Changed

- (dataset/sample/problem_definition) save and load methods starting with `_` are deprecated.
- (huggingface bridge) restructuration: do not rely on binary blobs anymore, but exploit native arrow types by flattening cgns trees into constant and variable parts (for stationnary and temporal datasets).
- (sample) Restructuring of the Sample class to store a global (tensor of arbitrary order) at a given time step: replaces scalar and time_series. All Sample data are now stored in CGNS trees.

### Fixes

- (meshes) fix `get_field_name`, could overwrite arguments during iteration over times, bases, zones and locations.
- (docs) explain release process in Contributing page.

### Removed

- (sample/features) cgns links and paths, as well as args `mesh_base_name` and `mesh_zone_name`

## [0.1.9] - 2025-09-24

### Added

- (problem_definition) add extract_problem_definition_from_identifiers method.
- (dataset) `get_tabular_from_stacked_identifiers` now returns stacked tabular and the cumulated feature dims, to be able to split columns to match features and then to revert the operation.
- (dataset) add option `keep_cgns` to `extract_dataset_from_identifier` to keep CGNS tree structure even if no identifiers need it.
- (`huggingface_bridge.load_hf_dataset_from_hub`) new utility to load datasets from the Hugging Face Hub, supporting both proxy and non-proxy environments.

### Changed

- (`huggingface_bridge.to_plaid_sample`) now accepts hf_dataset[id] directly as input (with pickle loading handled internally).

### Fixes

- (pipelines) fix `ColumnTransformer.inverse_transform` to use appropriate input identifier, and to keep CGNS tree structure when extracting sub-dataset.
- (examples) corrected and improved downloadable examples and the associated documentation notebook.
  - Improved integration with huggingface_bridge.to_plaid_sample.
  - Significantly faster on first retrieval when the dataset is already cached locally.

- Refactor the `containers/sample.py` module by introducting `SampleScalars` and `SampleMeshes` in `containers/features.py` that handle the scalars and meshes mechanics. Some methods are removed from `Sample`.
- Move to jupytext for notebooks and examples handling (unique source for both).
- Move to Muscat=2.5.0 (for tests and examples support).
- Update repo configuration (actions: rely more on pypi dependencies, action versions).
- Rename types to remove `Type` from name of types: https://github.com/PLAID-lib/plaid/pull/164.
- Refactored method names for improved clarity:
  - `Dataset.from_tabular` → `Dataset.add_features_from_tabular`
  - `Dataset.from_features_identifier` → `Dataset.extract_dataset_from_identifier`
  - `Sample.from_features_identifier` → `Sample.extract_sample_from_identifier`

### Fixes
